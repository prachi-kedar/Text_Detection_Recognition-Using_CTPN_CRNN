## Indentify unique ID from Egyptian National ID Cards
> A pure pytorch implemented ocr project.
Text detection is based CTPN and text recognition is based CRNN.  


## Prerequisite

- python-3.5+
- pytorch-0.4.1+
- torchvision-0.2.1
- opencv-3.4.0.14
- numpy-1.14.3


### Preprocessing
To detect the unique ID from the image we need to find ROI from an Image.
This can be done by writing simple script to crop an image.
![ROI](images_dataset/image.jpeg)


### Detection
Detection is based on [CTPN]
![detect1](test_result/CustNID_19093570011.jpg)

### Recognition
Recognition is based on [CRNN]


### Run the Code

>python3 demo.py

The image files in ./test_images will be tested for text detection and recognition, the results will be stored in ./test_result.

If you want to test a single image, run
>python3 test_one.py [filename]
